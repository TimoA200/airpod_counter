## FAQ

### Why is there no dark mode
There is. Just look closer. \
Maybe you only use the app outside where the app detects your system theme settings.

### What data is used?
We collect data concering:
- creditcard information (for in-app payments)
- contacts (so you can invite other people to count with you)
- your bank inforamtion (trust us)

### Backups
There are no backups, because the whole point of the app is to count. So just start over!
